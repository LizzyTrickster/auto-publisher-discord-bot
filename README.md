Auto-publisher
####

A very basic bot that uses Python and discord.py to auto-publish messages posted in any "annoucnement" channels.

There is no config, it will publish whatever it can. The bot user needs `send_messages` and `manage_messages` perms on the channel it should auto-publish for.

I likely wont be adding anything outside of the initial commit to this code. Use another bot or code your own if you want more features.
